' Pure WMI commands
' Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is one of the hidden treasures of Microsoft's operating systems.
' WMI Script to List Services
' 	1) As you get to know me, you will realize that I love variables. This script gave me a real challenge, I wanted to introduce strService so that I could change easily from the boring Alerter to the more useful Pop3Svc, here is the difficulty,
' 	("Select * from Win32_Service Where Name =" & strService & " ").  I solved the problem by precise positioning of the two sets of speech marks, moreover, when I declared strService, it required the syntax " 'Alerter' " and not plain " Alerter ".  Those were trivial points but they can drive you mad if you don't work with VBScript every day.
'	2) If you are going to adapt this for a production task, then you may need to remove either line 24 objService.StopService() or two lines further down, objService.StartService(). 
' 	However, Efrain D. kindly wrote in and said that he wished to restart, in which case leave in both and possible increase sleep 15000 to 30000, each 1000 is represents a one second delay.
'	3) I almost forgot, you also need to change strComputer ="." to strComputer = "Victim2 or whichever machine you wish to control.
'	4) As this is a test script, I introduced a delay with WScript.Sleep, the values are in mille seconds so 15000 are just 15 seconds.
'	5) Even though there is only one computer, the script still needs the loop: For Each....In... Next.  Believe me, I tried to simplify the script by removing the loop, but all I got was an object required error.
